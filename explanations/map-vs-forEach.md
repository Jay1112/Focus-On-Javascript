## map 

- map creates new array without changing the original array.
- it can be chained with other array methods.
- map returns the transform value of an element.

## forEach

- forEach does not create new array
- it can be chained with other array methods.
- forEach returns undefined for each Element.
- it is slightly faster than map because it does not create any new array.
